# porfolio-project

I created my portfolio as my final course in SheCodes came to a close. 

This started off using a template, created by a designer, on Figma. I had to create the webpage based off of the design plans. This allowed me to take in the real world experience of making a pixel perfect website from a designer, while also using and becoming familiar with Figma. After the basic outline of the website was created using HTML, I worked on personalizing the information; adding my email, links and photos. Then, I used CSS to style and make finishing touches on my porfolio. It was a blast to create, and I really enjoyed making this fully functional, multi-page website. Created with just HTML and CSS, it is responsive and functional on all screen sizes.

Feel free to check it out, see my featured projects, and learn more about me and my career change into Frontend Development.
