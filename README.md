# porfolio-project

I created my portfolio as my final course in SheCodes came to a close. 

This started off using a template, created by a designer, on Figma. I had to create the webpage based off of the design plans. This allowed me to take in the real world experience of making a pixel perfect website from a designer, while also using and becoming familiar with Figma. After the basic outline of the website was created using HTML, I added the CSS styling, and creating the hamburger menu using Bootstrap. I then worked on personalizing the information; adding my email, links and photos. Then, I used CSS to style and make finishing touches on my porfolio. Once I was able to determine that it was completed in regards to the designers plans, I added a few personal touches, such as a custom homepage logo, and a bit on animation. It was a blast to create, and I really enjoyed making this fully functional, multi-page website. Created with just HTML and CSS, it is responsive and functional on all screen sizes.
